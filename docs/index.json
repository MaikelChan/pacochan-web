Easy, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? But that\u0026rsquo;s not exactly what I\u0026rsquo;m here to talk about. I\u0026rsquo;m talking about when you have a music file that contains an intro. The idea is to play the intro once and then the rest of the song in a loop, something very typical in videogames.\nIf you look for tutorials, in forums or blogs, you will see people always explaining one of these two methods:\nSeparate the intro and the rest of the song into two different files, play the intro only once, and then loop the rest. Write some code that gets every frame the number of the sample that is currently playing, detects when the audio is about reach the end, and sets a sample number that corresponds to just when the intro ends so that Unity rewinds and plays that part again. Both methods are not perfect: they may have small audio cuts, or involve having extra code processing each frame.\nSo what if I told you that there is a better, perfect and efficient way to do this, that apparently nobody knows about? I assure you that I have searched many tutorials, forum threads and blogs, and I have never seen anyone comment on this method, I have not even seen it documented in the official Unity documentation! But one day I discovered it by chance.\nHow it\u0026rsquo;s done # The key thing that nobody knows is that Unity automatically detects loop points in WAV files. Many won\u0026rsquo;t know that this format supports loop points, since most audio programs don\u0026rsquo;t support this feature. But there is one that I have always used for these matters, that works very well, is free and not very well known: Wavosaur. The only drawback is that it is Windows exclusive and I don\u0026rsquo;t know of similar alternatives for other operating systems.\nWith this program you can open an audio, set loop points and save it as WAV:\nOpen the audio file in Wavosaur. Select approximately the area of the audio that you want to loop. Go to the Tools/Loop/Create loop points menu. This will create the loop points, indicated in yellow with the texts Loop start and Loop end. Zoom in and drag the loop points precisely so that when the playback point returns to the start of the loop, it does so without any noticeable cuts or clicks. Check that the loop is playing correctly by double-clicking inside the loop area to select it, activate the little Loop button, and press play. The audio will repeat at the points you have marked. Once you are satisfied, save the file in WAV format by going to the File/Save As... menu. Import the audio into Unity, place it in an AudioSource, activate Loop and Unity will be able to play the audio keeping the loop points without the need to do any weird tricks or write a single line of code. Conclusion # I discovered this little trick by chance, one time that I imported an audio that already had some loop points that I made years ago for use in another program. Unity didn\u0026rsquo;t play the audio from start to finish and at first I didn\u0026rsquo;t know why, until I decided to check if the audio had loop points (I didn\u0026rsquo;t remember I put them in), and I confirmed that it did and they matched how Unity played the audio.\nSo I hope this is helpful. I still can\u0026rsquo;t believe I haven\u0026rsquo;t been able to find anyone else who knows about this\u0026hellip; but there has to be someone out there, right?\n","date":"25 April 2024","permalink":"/articles/how-to-loop-music-with-intro-unity/","section":"Articles","summary":"Those of you who have a bit of experience using Unity, probably know that to play an audio loop you just need to create an AudioSource, assign an AudioClip and check the box that says Loop.

Some tricks are not so well known and others may sound a bit obvious, but you would be surprised how many times I have come across developers making such mistakes.\nMany people don\u0026rsquo;t notice many of these problems because they develop only on PC, and a PCs usually has enough raw power to process whatever you throw at them without any problems. But if you then proceed to port to consoles\u0026hellip; get ready for some fun.\nAlthough most of the games I port are made in Unity and the examples I\u0026rsquo;m going to show are also made with this engine, what I\u0026rsquo;m going to say can be applied to any engine.\nTextures # It is obvious that if the textures have less resolution, they will take less memory and therefore less loading times or out of memory crashes, at the cost of looking more blurred or pixelated. But there are certain interesting details that people often miss.\nCompression # It is important to watch that the dimensions of the textures have sizes multiples of 4: The compression formats that are used to have textures compressed efficiently in the memory of the GPU (VRAM), as for example DXT, ETC, PVRTC or ASTC, keep their data in blocks of 4x4. If the dimensions of a texture do not have a size multiple of 4, that texture will remain totally uncompressed in the VRAM, taking much more space.\nPractically all the games I have ported have had this problem to a greater or lesser extent, but a curious example was a visual novel that had some backgrounds at 1920x1080\u0026hellip; but not all of them. There were quite a few that by mistake were 1920x1079. This \u0026ldquo;small\u0026rdquo; difference made that these textures went from taking only 1MB of memory thanks to the compression, to taking 5.9MB in spite of their dimensions being a little smaller. As the game loaded a lot of backgrounds at the same time, it caused the Nintendo Switch to crash due to lack of memory. Luckily fixing it was very easy, rescaling the backgrounds to 1920x1080, and therefore being able to be compressed.\nScale # Even if we had plenty of memory, we must be careful about using large textures if they are always going to be seen at a smaller scale on the screen. One game used huge images for avatars that appeared small on the HUD during gameplay. When a large texture is displayed at reduced size it can cause aliasing. In 3D objects this is usually improved with mipmaps, but in HUDs, menus and interfaces in general, knowing at what size the elements are always going to be seen, and given that they are 2D and there is no perspective, we will avoid the aliasing problems if we reduce the size of the texture approximately to the real size at which it is going to be seen in screen.\nWho would have thought that the image on the right would look better despite having less resolution. And it consumes much less memory! Channel packing # The material of an object is usually composed of several textures that represent the color, relief, roughness, metalness, ambient occlusion, light emission, etc. The textures of some of these elements, such as roughness, ambient occlusion and metalness, are in black and white. Channel packing would be to combine these three textures in the R, G and B components of a color texture, thus optimizing the rendering. Then with a shader those three components can be separated again to obtain the data of the three original textures.\nMemory # This may sound a bit obvious\u0026hellip; but don\u0026rsquo;t load the entire game into memory. I\u0026rsquo;ve come across two games that load absolutely all the data into memory, and by all the data I mean ALL of it. All levels, all textures, all 3D models, all audio, etc. And neither the Switch, PS4 or Xbox One could even boot them.\nWhat they intended was to optimize loading times and prevent the game from stuttering during gameplay due to having to load assets. In fact, loading things ahead of time is a very correct solution\u0026hellip; but without going overboard!\nOne of the games in question was divided into 5 levels, and they were very heavy. Lots of assets, lots of effects and lots of plugins from the Unity asset store. Both my boss and the developer himself didn\u0026rsquo;t expect the game to be ported to Switch. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel like giving up. It took a lot of work, and with the developer\u0026rsquo;s help, I had to redo a lot of the game\u0026rsquo;s systems, all its asset management, and even fix memory leaks. The game was made in a way that made it very difficult to separate the data for each level. But I was finally able to make each level unload all its data after completion. That and with a LOT of optimizations of graphics, audio and\u0026hellip;. everything basically, finally the game was playable from start to finish. On top of that, the last level was the worst, because it was bigger and with more stuff than the other four combined\u0026hellip; I think I spent almost a month working on that level alone. But I got it, and at 30fps stable on Switch, PS4, and Xbox One, and at 60fps on PS5 and Xbox Series.\nSo please, be careful about loading everything at once in medium to large games.\nSound # A very simple way to improve the memory consumption of music is to set it to Streaming mode. Music and certain ambient sounds are usually the longest types of audio, and therefore, the ones that consume more memory. In Streaming mode, the entire audio is not loaded, but small chunks of it are loaded as it is played. But this consumes a little more CPU, so it is not recommended to use this mode in short audios or those that play repeatedly and frequently.\nDraw calls # The graphics rendering process starts from the CPU. The engine code will gather every frame all the objects that are visible on the screen and will start sending commands to the GPU for it to know what to render (draw a certain 3D object, with a certain shader, with certain lighting parameters, with certain textures, etc). Each drawing command is a draw call, and sending commands to the GPU has a cost, so the less the better.\nGenerally speaking, the idea is that there shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be too many small objects or objects with too many different materials. Each object and each material on that object would generate a draw call. It is better to try to combine the textures of each element of the object into one, its materials and also its 3D models.\nTo give an example, a street lamp I saw in a game had each of its parts, including the screws that anchor it to the ground in the form of individual objects. The CPU generated about ten draw calls per street lamp, which was totally unnecessary, and could be reduced to just one. It was only required to combine all the pieces in a 3D modeling program.\nThere are other factors that can increase the number of draw calls, such as the number of lights and shadows that affect an object. So keep an eye on that too.\nOverdraw # This is a concept that many people don\u0026rsquo;t know about and it is very important. If a game has performance problems due to graphics, many people resort to reducing the amount of polygons or texture resolution, even if that is not the problem. It is much easier to have performance problems due to overdraw than to excess polygons.\nOverdraw is, as it sounds, the drawing of pixels multiple times. For every pixel on the screen, the GPU does a certain amount of work to do the calculations necessary to determine the color of that pixel. The shader would be the code running on the GPU that determines the color, based on the shape of the object, lighting, texture, reflections, shadows, etc. If an object is drawn on the screen, for example a cube, and then another one is drawn in front of it to cover it, a sphere for example, all the pixels that cover those of the cube will have to be drawn twice: once for the cube and once for the sphere. That means having wasted time drawing part of the cube if it is going to be hidden anyway.\nWith opaque objects, most engines optimize this automatically by drawing the objects in order from closest to the camera to farthest away. Going back to the example above, if the sphere is drawn first and then the cube behind it, the GPU will check via the Z-buffer that there are a number of pixels on the cube that the sphere will cover, so the GPU won\u0026rsquo;t bother to calculate them.\nHowever, there may be exceptions to this, since sorting objects from closest to farthest is not 100% reliable. Here is an example:\nHere are two intersecting objects. The large one on the right covers a good part of the one on the left. But the point of origin of the object on the right (its center in this case), is actually farther back than the point of origin of the object on the left. If the object on the right covers the one on the left, it is only because it is larger. So, for the engine, the one on the right is farther away than the one on the left, so it renders it later. With the help of a graphics debugger like RenderDoc, we can see the overdraw. The intersecting part of the two objects looks lighter pink. That means that all those pixels are being rendered twice unnecessarily. In a case like this it is difficult or impossible to fix the overdraw 100%, but sometimes there are tricks to mitigate it, as we will see later.\nBut with transparent or semi-transparent objects you have to be careful. In those you can see the objects behind them, so the GPU will not be able to do any optimization with the Z-buffer, but will always re-render all pixels of each semi-transparent object. Tree leaves, bushes, particle systems, etc. can very easily destroy the frame rate of the game.\nFirst example: 3D scene with vegetation # Let\u0026rsquo;s take as an example this night scene of a park:\nThis game was originally running at 2fps on Switch. I had to optimize a lot of things to get it to 30fps stable, but one of them, and a very important one, was to reduce the overdraw. With a graphics debugger I was able to confirm that the Switch GPU was bottlenecked. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the overdraw view provided by the debugger in that scene:\nThis image represents that there are areas with a lot of overdraw. The ground has hardly any, it looks purple, but as we look towards the leaves of the trees, the colors become more intense, going through blues, yellows, reds and whites.\nTwo main things I did are:\nAll the polygons representing the leaves of the trees and the bushes, were set up to render two-sided. In a scene with so much vegetation it meant a lot of overlapping polygons. So I disabled two-sided rendering for all of them. That made the trees look weird and much less leafy, as they were not meant to have their leaves visible from one side. So I manually edited the 3D model of each tree, strategically repositioning the polygons, rotating them and even deleting some that were redundant, so that the trees looked leafy again but with the extra benefit of reducing the overdraw by about half.\nThe terrain, despite being opaque, generated overdraw in some places. Because it is large, Unity could not correctly determine which areas of the terrain were in front or behind some objects, depending on the camera angle. Since the terrain generally marks the lowest part of the stage, the floor of it, I forced Unity to render it after all the other objects. This can be easily done by increasing the Render Queue of the terrain material. Other engines will have another way to do the same thing. Thanks to that and the magic of the Z-buffer, by rendering the terrain after everything else, the GPU can determine which areas of the screen contain objects that would cover the terrain, so it can ignore rendering it in all those areas.\nWith all that, the overdraw view now looks like this:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a big improvement and the performance improved considerably. But unfortunately it was not enough for the Switch. When all the optimization possibilities are over (and I did more things that I don\u0026rsquo;t remember well anymore), it\u0026rsquo;s time to start making sacrifices, always as last resort: I had to reduce the drawing distance and make simplified versions of the trees to show above certain distances. However, thanks to the previous optimizations, I was able to avoid having to reduce the drawing distance much more than necessary. And this is how the overdraw view finally looks like:\nWith an animation you can better see the difference between each image:\nAnd this makes a big difference in performance for a GPU, and more so on mobile devices such as phones, tablets, and the Nintendo Switch, which are more susceptible to these kinds of problems.\nSecond example: 2D scene # In 2D games it is also quite important, because they usually have many semi-transparent textures. Let\u0026rsquo;s take a simple scene with a sky and three layers of mountains, each one made with a rectangle with a texture applied (first image). The transparent parts of the mountain texture are an unnecessary cost. Although they are invisible, the GPU processes the whole rectangle (second image). That is why it is usually preferable to add more polygons to the rectangle and give it the approximate shape of the texture (third image), because removing those invisible areas more than compensates in terms of performance than the tiny cost of processing a few more polygons.\nIn fact, some engines like Unity already do this automatically. Applying a texture to a Sprite Renderer will generate a polygon in the shape of the texture.\nThird example: particle system # If there are dips in the frame rate when looking at certain particle effects, you have to watch out if there\u0026rsquo;s an excess with the number of particles or with the complexity of the particle shader. This example is of a simple smoke effect:\nThe smoke on the left generates a lot of overdraw since it is generating 100 particles per second. It can be easily optimized by reducing the number of particles, and increasing the opacity and particle size to compensate for the reduction in particle density. The result is the smoke on the right, with a considerable reduction in particles (8 per second) but still looking quite close to the original.\nConclusion # All of these are just a few things that I remembered, and I may update the article if I come up with more.\nWhatever it is, it is always advisable to use the right tools to identify performance problems, such as profilers and debuggers. Avoid simplifying graphics or reducing textures without knowing if they are really the problem.\n","date":"12 January 2024","permalink":"/articles/game-optimization-tricks/","section":"Articles","summary":"To start this year 2024, I thought of writing about various techniques, tricks and curiosities on how to optimize a game, based on what I have seen in the projects I port to consoles.","title":"Game optimization tricks and anecdotes"},{"content":"","date":"12 January 2024","permalink":"/tags/performance/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Performance"},{"content":"Miguel Rivera (PacoChan) operates the https://pacochan.net website.\nThis page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use my website.\nIf you choose to use my website, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy.

Back then it was common to use a style called Skeuomorphism, which basically consisted of using real life objects or elements inside the interfaces. They were much more complex and overloaded than today, but they have a certain appeal that I find very interesting. Here are some examples of programs I had that show what I mean.\nCreative Writer # The example that first comes to my mind is a software / game from the 90\u0026rsquo;s called Creative Writer from Microsoft. It basically consisted of a set of tools designed for writing all kinds of texts, sort of like Office but for kids. And what fascinated me is the fact that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t just a set of tools and that\u0026rsquo;s it, but that you were immersed in an imaginary world called Imaginopolis, with several characters that you could interact with, and that took place mainly in a building with all kinds of gadgets to help you write articles, stories, notes, etc.\nThis building has several floors, each with various things to do, and was also full of easter eggs that appeared depending on where on the screen you clicked. The main character is a purple-colored character named McZee, and he is the one who guides and helps you through the program. This was a character that appeared in several other games and interactive programs developed or published by Microsoft.\nAnd this made my imagination run wild. I felt like I was really in that building and I was just another one working and doing creative things with my fictional partners. And along with Creative Writer there was another similar program called Fine Artist, which was more focused on art and drawing. And if you had both programs, you could link them together and easily go from one to the other, since Fine Artist runs in the building next door. I only had Creative Writer when I was growing up, and since I\u0026rsquo;ve always been more artistically inclined than literary, I would have liked Fine Artist better, but I still had a blast exploring and writing nonsense.\nThe Lost Mind of Dr. Brain # Another game I liked a lot from the ones I had as a kid on PC is The Lost Mind of Dr. Brain, which is a puzzle game about a mad scientist (Dr. Brain) who lives in a castle and does weird experiments. One goes wrong, and he ends up crossing his mind with that of a rat and they both go catatonic. And it\u0026rsquo;s Dr. Brain\u0026rsquo;s niece, Elaina, who is in charge of guiding you and operating the machines that make you get inside Dr. Brain\u0026rsquo;s mind to solve puzzles and thus fix the whole mental mess.\nAgain, the menus are basically rooms with characters and full of gadgets that I find fascinating. There was a time when I was a kid when I dreamed of being an inventor, and I spent my days drawing all sorts of nonsensical machines, with their gears, wires, buttons, screws and Tesla coils. And it\u0026rsquo;s possible that this game was one of my main inspirations. I loved the idea of imagining myself tinkering with huge machines and doing experiments.\nMindmaze in Encarta 96 # Encarta was a well-known encyclopedia from Microsoft that also included an educational game called Mindmaze that consisted of going through a medieval maze by answering questions about different topics, which you could then learn more about by reading the related article in the encyclopedia. I must say that as a kid I was much more fond of the game than the encyclopedia. I can\u0026rsquo;t imagine a current encyclopedia including something like this.\nIntroduction to IBM Aptiva # Another thing that I found very interesting, even without being a game or being of the same style as the previous examples, was the introduction tutorial that came with my first PC, an IBM Aptiva from the year 96 or 97. That interactive tutorial was so flashy, colorful, full of animations and music, that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t avoid completing it many times for the simple fact of enjoying the effort that was put to make it. Being also my first contact with my first PC, I\u0026rsquo;m quite nostalgic about it.\nWindows XP era # Moving forward in time, entering the 2000\u0026rsquo;s, Windows XP was released with a new way of making interfaces: full of colors, gradients, and more plastic-like. We all know the famous green and blue aesthetics, although personally I used to have the olive green theme. And among all the programs that came with Windows XP, there was one that always caught my attention. A not so popular browser called MSN Explorer. Everyone was using Internet Explorer or an alternative like Firebird (before it was renamed Firefox), but MSN Explorer was also included with the operating system. However it required a subscription to MSN, which surprisingly still exists today. Internally it was really Internet Explorer, but they decided to make a more colorful interface based on the MSN aesthetic. I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what it is, but I\u0026rsquo;ve always felt it looked pretty nice.\nBut one thing we can\u0026rsquo;t forget is how that era was the pinnacle of customization. You could do everything to Windows XP, and there were third-party programs that allowed you to do even more. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if you ended up with your eyes bleeding, anything went, and everyone could express their tastes by customizing Windows.\nI have a screenshot of my desktop from 2007. In a way it\u0026rsquo;s like a time capsule where I can see what I had and what I was doing back then. I usually didn\u0026rsquo;t configure Windows with such outlandish themes as in the examples above. But I must say, I was quite a fan of the surreal wallpapers that were also in vogue back then.\nAnd all this was not only limited to Windows, many programs that were configurable also ended up with all kinds of skins. Let\u0026rsquo;s not forget the legendary music player Winamp, which I used a lot for many years. While I was writing this article I found that there is the Winamp Skin Museum with a lot of themes for all tastes to download.\nKai Krause # When I see the aforementioned MSN Explorer and some Windows XP interfaces, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but think of Kai Krause, a designer (among other things) who was very influential in this type of aesthetics and who many mimicked. His intention was to make software that was more user-friendly based on rounded and organic elements. He called this style Padded Cell Design, a design which you can\u0026rsquo;t hurt yourself with. Some of the best known programs he designed are Kai Power Tools and Bryce, used for photo editing and 3D respectively.\nFinal thoughts # Graphic design today seeks to be as minimalist and simple as possible to communicate information in the most direct way and with the least amount of distractions. Obviously that has a handful of advantages to help you concentrate better on what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to do or make it easier to see for people who may have vision problems or other difficulties.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve always been someone who values the sensations I get from imagining myself inside the world of a video game, a book, or an illustration. Exploring magical, weird or dreamy places is something I really enjoy. And this kind of designs that I have been mentioning makes my imagination fly. So, even though ironically I have studied graphic design and I have been taught to flee from the overloaded and superfluous, I find simple and minimalist design boring. Functional, yes, but that\u0026rsquo;s it. Maybe it would be nice to find a balance, a more modern skeumorphic aesthetic. But well, maybe that\u0026rsquo;s just me.\n","date":"10 October 2023","permalink":"/articles/appreciation-old-software-design/","section":"Articles","summary":"Something that I like a lot and that was quite common in the 90\u0026rsquo;s and 2000\u0026rsquo;s but has been completely lost since then is the way in which the interfaces of some games or software were designed.","title":"Appreciation of old software design"},{"content":"","date":"10 October 2023","permalink":"/tags/design/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Design"},{"content":"","date":"10 October 2023","permalink":"/tags/nostalgia/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Nostalgia"},{"content":"If you have played and completed Without Escape, you may have seen in the extras section an option called Background in which I explain where the idea of making the game initially came from.

There I explain how, when I was a kid who still had very little programming knowledge and didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to make games, I made a small text adventure based on web files. It was about escaping from your own house after being invaded by zombies. And although it didn\u0026rsquo;t contain any images, the mental image I had of the house in which it takes place is the one that ended up in Without Escape. In fact, even some of the things you can do in Without Escape come from this text adventure.\nBackground section in Without Escape. The zombie theme came from me being an obsessed fan of the Resident Evil series. And I couldn\u0026rsquo;t think of a better thing to do than to name this textual adventure\u0026hellip; well\u0026hellip; Resident Evil (That\u0026rsquo;s why in Without Escape, the screenshot of the text adventure has some blurred parts\u0026hellip; Copyright and such). Another detail is that in the screenshot the game appears in English, but I actually only did it in Spanish (I knew very little English at that time). I simply edited it because I was suggested to make the screenshot more understandable internationally.\nWhat happened to the game? # And now you might be thinking\u0026hellip; Oh, this is all well and good, but it sounds like one of those things that have been lost over the years\u0026hellip; but no! I still have this game saved since 2002. And I think that, although it\u0026rsquo;s a childish nonsense that makes me a little embarrassed, maybe it would be nice to make it public for the first time\u0026hellip; just in case someone is curious about it.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve had this idea of making it public for a long time, but apart from the embarrassment, the game is made with Microsoft Word 2000. I didn\u0026rsquo;t even use Microsoft Frontpage, which was a common software to make websites back then that already had a bit of a bad reputation (also I didn\u0026rsquo;t even have internet back then and I did what I could). Word was worse, and made the web files\u0026hellip; very Microsoft-like: totally lacking in web standards and bloated with a lot of Microsoft-specific stuff in the code, apart from a really crappy way of organizing the files and folders. In case you don\u0026rsquo;t know, back then it was the wild west in terms of web standards, and each company did whatever they wanted. So my humble text adventure doesn\u0026rsquo;t work too well in today\u0026rsquo;s browsers: sounds don\u0026rsquo;t work and things get messed up depending on the size of the window (it\u0026rsquo;s designed for a miserable 800x600 resolution).\nAnd here I am, 21 years later, and I\u0026rsquo;ve finally decided to fix it and make it public. And well, I\u0026rsquo;ve basically redone it from scratch.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s new # For this new version my intention was to make the game comfortably playable in today\u0026rsquo;s browsers, but keeping completely the essence of the original (maintaining also the crappy and embarrassing factor). I\u0026rsquo;ve simply corrected some typos and fixed some text that wasn\u0026rsquo;t very understandable. I have also done a quick English translation so that more people can understand it. And one of the three endings it has is now a little easier to obtain. In the original it was practically impossible, it was more for trolling than anything else.\nFrom a technical point of view, the game no longer consists of each room being an HTML file, but is now all done in JavaScript. This has allowed me to make some things more dynamic, like being able to change the language at any time, turn the audio on or off, or make the background colors rescale dynamically according to the size of the window (the original used quite compressed fixed-size JPGs).\nHow to play it # Well, that\u0026rsquo;s the easiest part\u0026hellip; just click on the following link. So I hope you are not too hard on me for this and you find it at least interesting.

And each time I have to deal with this engine, one thing that pisses me off is how it handles textures. They can\u0026rsquo;t be compressed at all. For a long time, all textures in a game were stored in PNGs with transparency, taking a lot of disk space, RAM space and video memory (VRAM) space. I mean, PNG actually has some lossless compression (not much for certain kinds of images), but the contents of a PNG have to always be decompressed first before they can be seen or used. So in practice, it\u0026rsquo;s all uncompressed on the GPU\u0026rsquo;s VRAM. So, basically, they have a bit of compression when stored in disk, but they are decompressed when loaded into memory, which is what matters most.\nWhat I mean about texture compression is using formats like DXT, ETC, PVRTC or ASTC. These are special compression formats that are designed to be used without decompression by the GPU, that is, when having a texture compressed with any of these formats, it is loaded to the GPU\u0026rsquo;s VRAM, and the GPU will be able to render that texture without having to decompress it. So textures in VRAM take a lot less space, take less time to load, there\u0026rsquo;s no time spent in decompression, so more and bigger resolution textures will fit into memory and can improve the look of your game. And this is what the vast majority of games and game engines do\u0026hellip; except GameMaker.\nCan you let us choose, please? # Searching about this issue years ago, I found a thread in the GameMaker forums where people talked about the lack of compression options, and one of the devs basically said that compressing textures didn\u0026rsquo;t make sense as they would look bad on 2D games. There, no compression for you ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. I agree that in some cases like when using pixel art, compression looks really bad and it\u0026rsquo;s not recommended for that style. But how about letting people choose? And have they thought that maybe not all 2D games have pixel art and have big 2D illustrations that would benefit with the extra performance despite the barely noticeable quality loss? A lot of people have complained for many years about performance and memory problems in their games.\nIs it that hard to just add another option and let people choose? Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine a game like Hollow Knight (which luckily it wasn\u0026rsquo;t made with GameMaker). It is a beautiful 2D Metroidvania style game, really good by the way. Imagine all those sprites, backgrounds and animations fully uncompressed. That would have a series of consequences:\nIt would make the game tons of gigabytes bigger. This is the least of the problems, as there are games that surpass 100GBs nowadays anyway. But it\u0026rsquo;s unnecessary. Loading times would be a lot longer. The game would crash in a lot of systems as it would require a lot more RAM and a lot more VRAM that old systems might not have. A lot more stuttering caused by loading big textures on the fly during gameplay. So it would become a game much more demanding and difficult to optimize. Pixel art usually consists on really small textures, so having them all uncompressed is not an issue at all. But for the rest of 2D games\u0026hellip; I can assure you that many of them consume more VRAM that some big budget 3D games.\nThey tried\u0026hellip; # After many years of the engine not having compression options, one day they finally announced a new format. YAY! Hurray! And it\u0026rsquo;s called QOI. Textures are a bit smaller and faster to decompress than PNG. And that\u0026rsquo;s nice and all\u0026hellip; but we\u0026rsquo;ve got exactly the same problem. They have to be decompressed before they can be used\u0026hellip; so they still take a lot of memory once loaded\u0026hellip; so in practice still nothing has changed\u0026hellip;\nAlso they provided a variant compression format called BZ2+QOI, which is kind of like putting an image inside a Zip file. It has a bit better compression but decompression is A LOT slower. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not that noticeable on PC, but on the Nintendo Switch\u0026hellip; oh boy\u0026hellip; that format is unusable. It\u0026rsquo;s painfully slow. A couple of games I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on took like ten seconds to load each room, and then the gameplay was a stuttery and painful mess. And BZ2+QOI is what comes set by default. So the first thing I always have to do is to change all textures to QOI. And suddenly no more loading times and no more slowdowns. But still there\u0026rsquo;s the problem of crashes due to textures not fitting the VRAM\u0026hellip;\nIt gets worse # Speaking of loading times, I noticed that GameMaker games take a bit to boot. And on Switch is even worse. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked on games that took like 20 seconds to boot! In fact, the engine allows you to set a boot loading image so the game is not stuck at a black screen for that long. So what\u0026rsquo;s up with that? Recently I discovered the reason\u0026hellip; EVERY GAMEMAKER GAME LOADS ALL TEXTURES, ALL THE TEXTURES THAT THE WHOLE GAME HAS FROM BEGINNING TO END, INTO RAM DURING BOOT AND STAY THERE THE WHOLE TIME YOU PLAY THE GAME. TAKING A FUCKTON OF MEMORY.\nWhat any sane game engine does is as follows. Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that we want to render a wooden box:\nFirst the texture of the box is loaded from the hard disk or SSD into RAM. From RAM proceed to copy it to the GPU VRAM. Once the texture is in the VRAM, it is ready to be used and rendered. The texture that was loaded into RAM can be deleted, as it is not needed anymore. Having it on VRAM is all that\u0026rsquo;s needed for rendering. There are exceptions though. For example, if you want to do real-time changes to the texture, you want to keep it in RAM to edit it there, and then upload it again to VRAM after each change for rendering. But most of the time, you won\u0026rsquo;t need to keep the texture in RAM. And here comes PainMaker and not only keeps currently used textures in RAM unnecessarily\u0026hellip; keeps ALL OF THEM.\nAnd let\u0026rsquo;s think about the Switch, which only has 4GB of unified memory, and about 1GB is used by the operating system. So in practice, ~3GB of memory. Being unified memory means that those 3GB are used for BOTH RAM and VRAM, instead of being separated. In those miserable 3GB we need to fit all the textures of the game, and then duplicates of some of those textures for rendering (along with audio, buffers, code, etc). I\u0026rsquo;m guessing that on smartphones it will be a similar experience.\nThey\u0026rsquo;ve done some improvements though # Thank heavens\u0026hellip; just last year (2022, after 23 years since the engine exists) they added the possibility of not loading all textures into memory 🎊🎉🎉🎉🎊. You can load only the ones you need! The feature is called \u0026ldquo;Dynamic Texture Pages\u0026rdquo;, and that makes quite the difference. I\u0026rsquo;ve been reducing boot times a lot and I no longer have to worry about having low memory. But it takes some work when the game has not been designed to use this feature.\nConclusion # So in the end, a lot of these issues have been resolved actually. Very recently, but better late than never. I had to deal with them in my previous projects and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t fun. But for the current one, in which I was having memory issues and crashes, I discovered the \u0026ldquo;Dynamic Texture Pages\u0026rdquo; feature just a few days ago and it helped a lot. But there\u0026rsquo;s still the problem of textures being uncompressed in VRAM, which is pretty important. I hope to see the day in which they add proper compression formats so it finally works like a normal game engine.\n","date":"30 July 2023","permalink":"/articles/rant-gamemaker-texture-management/","section":"Articles","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m currently porting an indie game done with GameMaker to consoles.

I decided to rewrite it from scratch, improve it, and make it cross-platform.

And even if there is, I just wanted to make my own, what the hell.\nI have some kind of fascination or interest in save formats. I like to know how a game saves its data and all the secrets stored there. So a save editor is the perfect tool to learn about a save format, make the information visible and understandable, and be able to edit it easily. And I would like to work on save editors for other games. Banjo-Kazooie is one candidate.\nThe editor showing my save files from my youth, dumped from my actual cartridge from back in the 90\u0026rsquo;s. Some technical notes # The previous one was written in C# and the UI was done with WPF, hence the Windows exclusivity. Since I wanted to make it cross-platform, I rewrote it in C++. I\u0026rsquo;m not too comfortable with this language, so this was a bit of an exercise to improve my C++ skills. But making UI programs in C++ is a bit of a pain, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to deal with huge frameworks. So what better to use than ImGui. You might have seen some programs have interfaces done with this, as by default it has a very recognizable style.\nWith just a few code files added to the project, you can start building a UI that will work on everything, as it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any dependency on any operating system. The only requisite is to have a GPU, as this UI system renders frame by frame on top of a graphics API like Direct3D, OpenGL or Vulkan. Like what a video game does. In fact, this is commonly used to develop debug UIs for games or interactive applications.

Many people had their own personal website where they posted things they did, or commented on things they liked, or wrote about what they thought or felt. All that was accompanied by a unique, colorful and overloaded design, that, despite it can be considered quite old-fashioned for today standards and even hurtful for your eyes, I think they had charm and personality.\nMany of those sites had also small communities, which could be in the form of forums or IRC chats. If you wanted to participate somewhere, you had to create an account in it. And if you wanted to join another community, you also had to have an account there. There was nothing centralized. Everyone hosted and maintained their own community, and it was 100% in the hands of that person or persons.\nUntil social media appeared.\nThe Internet has changed a lot since then. Social media offered the advantage that they work as a huge, global community, where if you post something, anyone in the world can see it and give their opinion. You can make yourself heard more easily than ever before. But that also had some big disadvantages, because the big companies that develop these social media platforms have gained control of too many things. Virtually everything, all information, all opinions, all content, is in the hands of large multi-billion dollar corporations. That sounds like the plot of a cyberpunk movie, but it is nothing less than reality. And those companies can do whatever they want with that content and its users. They can monetize it, include advertising, hide or highlight content through mysterious algorithms, and so on. Not to mention the capitalistic and addictive spiral that it entails for many people. Those who make content will want it to stand out, even if they have to resort to clickbait or lie and manipulate, all for likes and retweets. Whereas those who just read content, need to have the dopamine flowing endlessly by scrolling and watching content that never ends. This results in a lot of fake and shallow content. From the moment your intention is to monetize or get external approval, you are much more likely to resort to saying what people want to hear, instead of what you really think.\nLately I\u0026rsquo;ve been having this idea of going back to the old style, to having a traditional web or blog where I can show and comment things. That is one of the reasons why I have revived this website. But I have also discovered someone called Eric Murphy who makes videos on Youtube that has decided to do the same, to have a personal website and encourage people to make their own, and also show where to find them. Thanks to his website I have learned that there are communities of people who also miss that genuine era of personal websites, along with sites called Webrings that are basically directories of traditional websites. Sites that normally are very difficult to find in search engines, but can be found through these Webrings or by having them linked in other sites, generating a network of websites that are linked together and that allow you to discover more people that talk about similar topics that may interest you. Just like in the old days.\nI think that forums have been and still are the best way to form a community. Probably the most similar thing that we have nowadays is Discord, but it\u0026rsquo;s difficult and slow to find old messages, and the day the company disappears\u0026hellip; it\u0026rsquo;s scary just to think about the massive amount of information that will vanish forever.\nBy the way, do you remember Geocities? There were so many personal websites hosted there that offered such a variety of content, and unfortunately it ceased to exist in 2009 (in Japan in 2019). Well, there is a spiritual successor called Neocities that allows you to have your own website for free. And a lot of people have decided to do it in full 90\u0026rsquo;s mode, both in design and content, which I think is great!\nAnd this whole thing, besides that I find it more genuine and honest because people write what they think without being under the pressure of likes, it also has a nostalgic feel for me. I like the idea of being part of that movement, if we can call it that. And I am perfectly aware of the reality. Not many people are going to read this website, I\u0026rsquo;m not going to get likes and retweets as immediate feedback that gives instant gratification, and I\u0026rsquo;m not going to receive any kind of economic compensation, but I don\u0026rsquo;t care. Is it necessary that everything nowadays provides short term rewards? I just like the idea of having my little personal corner where I can show what I do and express myself, and if someone comes across this website and finds what I do interesting, then obviously I think that would be great and I\u0026rsquo;ll be glad to have been able to contribute something useful or valuable.\nWriting is not something I\u0026rsquo;m very good at and I\u0026rsquo;m not very eloquent, and I\u0026rsquo;m not gonna lie, it\u0026rsquo;s not something I like to do very much, so normally I\u0026rsquo;ve always had websites that are more about showing what I do than communicating what I think. But I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to try to express myself a little more about things that cross my mind or experiences that I find interesting to tell. So let\u0026rsquo;s see how it goes. I hope it\u0026rsquo;s not one of those things that I end up leaving abandoned due to lack of motivation. I know myself.\n","date":"12 July 2023","permalink":"/articles/state-of-the-internet/","section":"Articles","summary":"In the 1990s and early 2000s, the Internet was made up of many small websites.

I\u0026rsquo;ve always liked computers and video games, and of course I\u0026rsquo;ve had some interest in learning making them. In fact, I already did a veeery simple text adventure when I was a kid. But there was a game back in 2002, that was one of the main reasons of my big interest in game development.\nI\u0026rsquo;m talking about an unfinished small indie game. It\u0026rsquo;s a small Pokémon fangame called Pokémon PC, developed by Spirited Technology.\nPokémon PC logo. The day I found out about this game (don\u0026rsquo;t remember where), downloaded it, installed it and played it, something fascinated me. I found incredible that someone, totally on his own, developed his own engine and a 3D Pokémon game. Nowadays that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be that uncommon. Game development is more accessible than ever to everyone and there are all kinds of tools that make development a lot easier. But we are talking about 2002, times when indie game development was a lot more niche and difficult. Besides, I was an impressionable young kid, that only knew about the games on the Nintendo consoles he owned, and just a bit of what there was available for other consoles and PC, and that they were developed by these big mysterious and unreachable game companies (at least for someone that lives in a small mediterranean city). However, we\u0026rsquo;ve all had that friend that kept saying that had a cousin working for PlayStation.\nThis is where the adventure starts. And there I was, playing that Pokémon fangame, exploring a 3D world, with 3D battles, MIDI music, while my mind was blown out thinking that that was made by someone like you and me, and not one of those big companies. And I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop thinking\u0026hellip; But how? Where could I start doing something like this? I don\u0026rsquo;t recall if I did something about it immediately, but I definitely had that thought of wanting to learn for a long time.\nCoastal village near the beginning. Sadly, the author never finished the game. I remember how the demo ended in a city at the top of a hill, during night, that contained the first and only gym. The game is a little bit messy on today\u0026rsquo;s computers, but running it with Windows XP compatibility and with a bit of luck, the game is more or less playable. And I did say luck because it tends to freeze. I have replayed it recently, and despite one could consider it a bit crappy by today\u0026rsquo;s standards, I enjoyed a lot playing it again. I was able to reach the end again and I did everything there was to do.\nMy Entei wiping the floor with some random Pokémon. From what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen by checking out the author\u0026rsquo;s website through Web Archive, he lost the code while migrating PCs, so he never could continue it. However, he started a second part that had some graphical improvements, like dynamic shadows and a 360 degree rotating camera. I didn\u0026rsquo;t play this back in the day because I didn\u0026rsquo;t know about its existence until many years later, and because, for some reason, it\u0026rsquo;s harder to run on modern computers. The game always freezes while booting, no matter the compatibility mode. Probably the best option is to virtualize a Windows XP.\nThe only route that has trainers. A bit of reverse engineering # Due to all these problems I\u0026rsquo;ve been having, I decided to investigate and do a bit of reverse engineering to both games. On one side, I patched the supported resolutions and aspect ratio to be able to play at 16:9 and HD resolutions. On the other side, I investigated the reason of those freezes and tried to figure out if I could do something about it. It turns out that it happens on most UIs and menus. These are not properly implemented because their input processing is implemented in a loop that blocks the main loop. That means that the game waits constantly for the player to make an input to navigate the menu, preventing that the game can process other stuff like rendering and Windows events. Not being able to process Windows events (move and resize the window, press the title bar buttons, redraw the window, etc.) is what makes Windows think the game has frozen.\nWide route with a lot of Pokémon to catch. So, how is it that the game worked well back in the day? Well, it worked by chance. Back in those times, Windows handled frozen programs in a more rudimentary way. If a program froze, Windows didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything about it. It froze and that\u0026rsquo;s it, you had to kill the process. Nowadays, Windows can detect when a program stops processing Windows events, and after several seconds, the window turns whiter and it lets you close the window by just pressing the X button. Regarding these games, I guess Windows just let the game run without considering it frozen.\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s where the demo ends. Fixing this would be a bit complicated, as I would probably have to hack each menu of the game. But what I actually did is to remove the title screen of the second game, that would always make the game freeze. And as long as you don\u0026rsquo;t stay in a menu too long, the game is more or less playable. Remember to save frequently though.\nWith these workarounds I\u0026rsquo;ve been able to finish the second part for the first time while I was writing this article. I don\u0026rsquo;t have the same nostalgia as with the first game, and it is shorter and with less things to do, but I\u0026rsquo;m happy to have \u0026ldquo;completed\u0026rdquo; the Pokémon PC saga.\nThis is the patched second part. Conclusion # What was originally going to be an article about a game that was big inspiration, ended up being, in an improvised way, about how I tried to get my hands dirty to make it more playable. At least now is a more complete story about all my experience with these games, and what they mean to me.\nInterestingly, the author must have had one of those nostalgic days recently, because he uploaded in his Youtube channel, which is not about video games, a gameplay of the second part.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;d like to play them, the author put a download link in the description in the video, and here is the first part.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s catch them all!\n","date":"25 June 2023","permalink":"/articles/a-big-inspiration/","section":"Articles","summary":"From time to time some events happen in your life that, for one reason or another, end up changing your future.

It is based on the PC decompilation made by k4zmu2a: https://github.com/k4zmu2a/SpaceCadetPinball The Wii version is playable with the Wii remote and the GameCube pad. It should be running fine on New 3DS, but on a regular 3DS it runs slow.

It is done done with Unity and I\u0026rsquo;m pretty satisfied with what I was able to achieve in my first game jam for those few days.\nThe atmosphere, graphics and sound were the most praised aspects of my game. But the gameplay was the part that suffered the most. Since in the you move in a grid-like environment, I opted to implement dungeon crawler style controls, instead of normal FPS controls. And a lot of people didn\u0026rsquo;t fully grasp the gameplay, so it seems that I took the wrong decision there.\nStory # You have arrived to the city of Technopolis. The first thing you notice in this modern city is that there\u0026rsquo;s nothing natural to be found. However, you manage to acquire the only piece of land left with nothing built on it. So you decide to create your own garden to bring some life to this soulless city.\nHow to play # Your piece of land consists on a 10x10 grid and you can move from square to square in a first person view. You can sow a plant on each square, and after that you must water it regularly or else it will wither and die. You can sow other plants in other squares while the already existing plants are growing. Once a plant has fully grown into a tree, you won\u0026rsquo;t need to water it anymore. Your objective is to grow the highest amount of trees that you can before the time runs out.\nBut be careful! If you step on a square that contains a plant, you will damage it and it will take longer to fully grow. Sometimes you will have to step on a plant in order to reach and water another plant. So plan carefully where do you start sowing you plants and watch your steps to avoid damaging your plants as much as you can. Fully grown trees, along with 10 random rocks scattered through the land will block your way. They can make things harder for you!\nThis is the cycle of a plant as long as you water it in time:\nNothing -\u0026gt; Seed planted -\u0026gt; Small plant -\u0026gt; Bush -\u0026gt; Tree\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t water the plant in time or if you step on it, it will go back one step as follows:\nBush -\u0026gt; Small plant -\u0026gt; Nothing\nRemember that trees won\u0026rsquo;t die, and if a plant fully dies, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to plant the seed again.\nControls # W: Move forward S: Move Backward A: Rotate Left D: Rotate right Q: Strafe Left E: Strafe Right 1: Plant a seed 2: Water the seed / plant Screenshots # Download # https://pacochan.itch.io/city-gardener\n","date":"27 May 2023","permalink":"/games/city-gardener/","section":"Games","summary":"This is a small prototype I did in three days for a game jam, the Ludum Dare 42.","title":"City Gardener"},{"content":"","date":"27 May 2023","permalink":"/categories/demo/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Demo"},{"content":"","date":"26 May 2023","permalink":"/tags/chip8/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Chip8"},{"content":"","date":"26 May 2023","permalink":"/tags/superchip/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"SuperChip"},{"content":"Description # tsChip8 is an accurate Chip8 and SuperChip emulator written in TypeScript and rendered with WebGL.\nFor those who don\u0026rsquo;t know what Chip8 and SuperChip are, according to Wikipedia:\nCHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language, developed by Joseph Weisbecker. It was initially used on the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 8-bit microcomputers in the mid-1970s. CHIP-8 programs are run on a CHIP-8 virtual machine. It was made to allow video games to be more easily programmed for these computers.\nCHIP-8 has a descendant called SCHIP (Super Chip), introduced by Erik Bryntse. In 1990, a CHIP-8 interpreter called CHIP-48 was made for HP-48 graphing calculators so that games could be programmed more easily. Its extensions to CHIP-8 are what became known as SCHIP. It features a larger resolution and several additional opcodes meant to make programming easier.\nFeatures # Full Chip8 and SuperChip compatibility. Settings that allow to simulate wrong behaviours in order to execute problematic games. Four rendering modes that can be switched at any time: WebGL-LED: The game is shown in some kind of led screen in a virtual 3D environment, that features some realtime lighting and a screen refresh rate shader effect. Because why not! WebGL-Voxel: Similar to the WebGL renderer but the screen is rendered with GPU instanced voxels. Canvas: The game will be rendered into a 2D canvas. ASCII: The game will be rendered with text characters. Easy to implement since the Chip8 and SuperChip are monochrome. All rendering modes allow to customize rendering colors. Sound is also emulated. Chip8 has very basic sound capabilities. It\u0026rsquo;s only capable to reproduce a \u0026ldquo;beep\u0026rdquo; sound of configurable duration. It includes a bunch of public domain ROMs for you to play and test, and also a simple game made by myself called LOL Hunt. How to play # You can load any of the included ROMs in the list located at the top left corner of the window, and the press Play. You can also load a ROM stored in your device with the Load button.\nThe Chip8 / SuperChip key pad is mapped to the following keyboard keys (the inputs depend on each game):\n1 2 3 4 Q W E R A S D F Z X C V All included ROMs work out of the box. However, due to some features of the Chip8 being wrongly documented, there are some games out there with bad code that will present issues. If you see graphical glitches in a game, stop it, change the compatibility settings, and then hit Play again. Some games will require one of them enabled, or maybe even both. Try until you get the game working.\nScreenshots # Links # You can play the emulator here: tsChip8\nAnd here\u0026rsquo;s the source code: https://github.com/MaikelChan/tsChip8\n","date":"26 May 2023","permalink":"/software/ts-chip8/","section":"Software","summary":"tsChip8 is an accurate Chip8 and SuperChip emulator written in TypeScript and rendered with WebGL.","title":"tsChip8"},{"content":"","date":"26 May 2023","permalink":"/tags/web-browser/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Web Browser"},{"content":"","date":"26 May 2023","permalink":"/tags/playstation-2/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"PlayStation 2"},{"content":"Description # Tool to extract and edit texts and other localizable data from Resident Evil: Code Veronica for PlayStation 2, GameCube and Dreamcast.\nDownload # https://github.com/MaikelChan/RECV_Editor\n","date":"26 May 2023","permalink":"/software/recv-editor/","section":"Software","summary":"Tool to extract and edit texts and other localizable data from Resident Evil: Code Veronica for PlayStation 2, GameCube and Dreamcast.","title":"RECV Editor"},{"content":"","date":"26 May 2023","permalink":"/categories/translation-tool/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Translation Tool"},{"content":"","date":"25 May 2023","permalink":"/tags/macos/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"macOS"},{"content":"Description # I did several contributions for the PC port of Super Mario. The biggest of them was the Direct3D 11 renderer. Initially, the port only had Direct3D 12 and OpenGL renderers, and I wanted to try if I was able to do my own Direct3D 11 renderer, since I already had some experience with the API. I did achieve it without much complications. The author of the port was surprised because he did some performance tests and turned out that my renderer was the most performant of all, even more than the Direct3D 12 one, which is supposed to be the fastest. So it was the renderer that always recommended to use on Windows.\nBesides that, I also did some other contributions like implementing the transparent effect of the vanishing cap and when Mario teleports, and I emulated the texture filtering effect that is unique to the Nintendo 64, to offer a more authentic experience. I did these contributions to both Direct3D 11 and OpenGL renderers.\nSince, after the initial PC port, there were a lot of forks and alternative versions of the port, I must specify that all that I did was for the initial port. So in other ports and forks my renderer might have been changed or removed to give priority to OpenGL, as it works on all platforms, not only on Windows.\nVideos # I posted on Twitter some videos of the work in progress (in Spanish).

Those websites were hosted at Tales Translations, a community dedicated to fan-translating video games, mainly of the Tales of series. I was one of the founders and I worked on multiple translations. Years went by and it happened what it usually happens, it ended up being abandoned and inactive. That also affected my website, which has been offline for years and I haven\u0026rsquo;t done much about it.\nYears later, I have decided to rescue that website. I want to keep showing the stuff that I\u0026rsquo;ve done and keep doing, along with some old stuff that were never in my old websites. Hopefully this website is here to stay for a longer time and I will have the motivation to keep updating it. Maybe I will also write articles about stuff I think or that I\u0026rsquo;m learning.\nFor this website I decided to use a so called static site generator, a way of developing a website that I discovered recently that allows to have a somewhat complex website without the need of databases, PHP, and similar things. This way, one of the biggest advantages is that I won\u0026rsquo;t need to worry about updates, vulnerabilities, hacks, and all that jazz. To be specific, I used Hugo to make the website along with a template called Blowfish, to which I have contributed several bug fixes that solve some issues I stumbled upon. Another advantage is that I can host the site on GitHub completely free, as they offer that free service for static sites.\nHowever, one disadvantage of using this is that it is harder to have dynamic content like comments, contact forms, etc. If possible, I would like to preserve the comments of my previous websites. I have investigates some comments systems, but none of them fully convinces me. Some of them like Disqus are very popular, but slow down the site, are heavy, collect user data (like everyone nowadays\u0026hellip;), and if you don\u0026rsquo;t pay they add ads. Other systems allow you to host your own database, but it requires having some server to host it. I have my own VPS, but my intention was to reduce costs and the maintenance it requires. The one that convinces me the most is one called giscus, which is free and open source, and the comments are hosted on GitHub. The main disadvantage? You need a GitHub account to comment, which is something you can\u0026rsquo;t expect from non-developer people, and you can\u0026rsquo;t properly migrate comments from other systems. So I will leave comments disabled for now and let\u0026rsquo;s see if I come up with something.\nFor now I have migrated the content of my previous websites, and I will add more stuff I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing since.\nSo I hope my new website is somewhat interesting and hope you have a nice day!\n","date":"23 May 2023","permalink":"/posts/2023-05-23-new-page-decade-later/","section":"News","summary":"There was a time when I used to express myself more often on the internet, and I\u0026rsquo;ve had multiple websites throughout the years where I posted the projects I was doing or collaborating on.","title":"A decade later... new website... again"},{"content":"I’ve made another update to the editor.

So you\u0026rsquo;ll have to restart the whole game.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been investigating the cause of this glitch and the information Nintendo gave was correct, but incomplete. This is what happens:\nYou can activate the glitch if you choose Lanayru on the first or second place. The safest choice is to go to Lanayru after Eldin and Faron. The first time you land on Lanayru once the quest of collecting songs has started, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to reach a certain cave from two paths: from Lanayru Mine and from West Desert. If you land on Lanayru Mine (I think this is only possible on PAL versions of the game, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure), you\u0026rsquo;ll see a Goron right there. This is the first step to activate the glitch. But if you access the cave from West Desert, you\u0026rsquo;ll find that Goron inside the cave and you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t worry about getting the glitch. When you get the Thunder Dragon\u0026rsquo;s song, the Goron will still be at the place you found it the first time. As I said, the game will only break if you speak with him at Lanayru Mine. When you speak with him, the game will try to start the quest again. But you already have finished it and have the necessary objects. So, you cannot do anything at Lanayru, and you cannot start any other quest because technically you are still doing the Thunder Dragon\u0026rsquo;s quest. The game is broken. Even if you do Lanayru the last, I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend talking with the Goron at Lanayru Mine, because it still changes some events. You\u0026rsquo;ll be able to finish the game because you\u0026rsquo;ll already have finished the other song quests. But I haven\u0026rsquo;t discovered if it has some minor impact on any event. Download # So what if you already triggered the glitch? Don\u0026rsquo;t worry. I\u0026rsquo;ve made a Riivolution patch that can fix your save and prevent the glitch from happening again. You can download Riivolution here and get some information on how to use it. Once you have downloaded and put Riivolution on your SD card, you can download my patch:\nZelda Skyward Sword Game-Breaking Bug Fix v0.1\nInstructions # Copy the files to the SD card. Run Riivolution with Homebrew Channel. Leave everything as it is and click Launch. MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVE. Load your broken save. Save immediately after. Restart the game as you normally do. You won\u0026rsquo;t need the patch anymore. Your save should be fixed. The patch is compatible with both PAL and NTSC versions of the game. If you have any problem or question, contact with me. Here\u0026rsquo;s a Youtube video with a visual explanation of the glitch and how to fix it:\n","date":"8 December 2011","permalink":"/romhacking/zelda-skyward-sword-wii/","section":"Romhacking","summary":"At a certain point toward the end of the Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword, while collecting pieces of a certain Song, you’re tasked with visiting the Fire, Water and Thunder Dragons in any order you choose.","title":"The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword - Game-Breaking Bug Fix (Wii)"},{"content":"","date":"8 December 2011","permalink":"/tags/zelda-skyward-sword/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Zelda: Skyward Sword"},{"content":"Yup, the translation has finally been finished.

It’s full of all sorts of glitches and it’s extremely hard because of it’s glitched gameplay. The game couldn’t even be finished. However, it’s a very rare collector’s item and can be found for more than $1000.\nApeMan, the boss at the fourth level, disappears if he leaves the screen, and if you beat him, it also disappears, so you get stuck at that level and it’s impossible to go through the last two levels. Level two boss can disappear in some circumstances. There’s a hacked version of the rom that offers only the last two levels, but it’s also very buggy. The final boss dissapears too and it’s impossible to finish the game.\nNow, all of that is fixed and the game can be completed with no problems. No more enemies disappearing, all levels load correctly, and no annoying level number glitch (levels 4, 5 and 6 were called level 3).\nI made some palette and graphic modifications, to fix some elements that looked ugly. Also, I fixed some spelling errors in the intro.\nThe patch is in IPS format. If you don’t know how to use it, search the internet.

It\u0026rsquo;s an unlicensed NES game made by Active Enterprises, the bunch of geniuses that made Action 52, another game that sucks ass. But it\u0026rsquo;s so bad and there\u0026rsquo;s so much history behind these games that somehow it has its charm and there\u0026rsquo;s even some fan community out there. Besides, they are such rare games, especially Cheetahmen II (since it was never actually released, a few thousand copies were found in a warehouse when the company ceased to exist), that copies have been auctioned for more than $1000.\nSo I have decided to make a translation of the \u0026ldquo;fixed\u0026rdquo; version that can be found on this page, along with some more improvements such as changing the text colors to make it more readable. Now you can enjoy the game from beginning to end without bugs that make it unfinishable, and in Spanish. By the way, I took the opportunity of fixing some texts and typos, since the original was pretty badly written.

Each player plays holding one side of the console. When one of the players achieves 5, 15, 25, 35, etc. points, the screen will start rotating until one of the players scores a goal, making more difficult to be able to stop the ball. When one of the players achieves 10, 20 30, 40, etc. points, the top and bottom screens will start swapping each other twice per second, also making it more difficult to be able to stop the ball. When the ball goes through the star in the middle, the last player that touched the ball will be able to control the ball directly, dragging it with the touch screen. To be able to drag the ball, the L button (for the first player) or the R button (second player) must be held. This is a way of preventing the other player of also trying to move the ball with the touch screen. This mode deactivates after one second after the ball leaves the star in the middle, so the player will have to be quick to try to score a goal.
